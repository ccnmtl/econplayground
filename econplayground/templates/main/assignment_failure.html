            You appear to be struggling with the assignment material. It is
            recommended that you do some or all of the following:
        <p>
        <li>Contact your TA for review</li>
        <li>Look over your course notes</li>
        <li>Take a deep breath, maybe grab a snack. It's okay, you'll get better.</li>
    </ul>
