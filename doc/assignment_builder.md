## Assignments
Instructors can manage assignments in EconPractice here:

## Steps
An assignment is a collection of steps organized by the
instructor. Each step can have sub-steps attached to it.

When completing a step, the student is navigated to the subsequent
step in the assignment structure. If this step has a "Next step"
override defined, the student is instead navigated to this step.

## Questions
Each step of an assignment can optionally contain a question, with an
evaluation attached, referred to as a Rubric. A question may or may
not have a graph attached to it. If it does, the type of graph will
influence what type of values are available in the "Graph Assessment"
rubric type.

### Rubric
A question's correctness can be defined in the form of graph values,
i.e. "Graph Assessment", or with multiple choice.

In both cases, a series of rules are created to define the rubric.  We
will be fine-tuning exactly how the Graph Assessment rubric type
behaves as we use this tool, as building this kind of software is a
process of discovery. In the "Multiple Choice" rubric type, a single
choice can be defined as "Correct".
